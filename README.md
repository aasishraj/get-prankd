# ðŸŽ­ Get Prankd - Chrome Extension

A mischievous Chrome extension designed to prank users with two levels of keyboard interference.

## Features

### ðŸ”¹ Mildly Infuriating Mode
- Randomly replaces common words as you type in any text field
- Words like "the", "and", "you" get replaced with silly alternatives like "potato", "unicorn", "taco"
- Replacement mappings change every 30 seconds to keep things unpredictable

### ðŸ”¥ Outright Violation Mode  
- Completely remaps all alphanumeric keys to random other alphanumeric keys
- Like an unsolvable Enigma machine for your keyboard
- Key mappings shuffle every 30 seconds for maximum chaos
- Makes typing nearly impossible

## Usage

1. **Access the Extension**
   - Click the Get Prankd icon in your Chrome toolbar
   - A popup will appear with three mode options

2. **Select a Mode**
